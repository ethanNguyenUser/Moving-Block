Introduction:
MovingBlock was a physics-engine program that worked with concepts of velocity, acceleration, conservation of momentum, conservation of kinetic energy, electromagnetism,
and etc.

Specification Fulfillment:
The user-controlled block increments its velocity directionally according to arrow input. The block also undergoes an automatic set of accelerations which eventually
bring it to a stop at the clicked point. The block can also visit a whole series of points. Given multiple blocks including those of different masses, they can collide
elastically and conserve momentum and kinetic energy. For blocks of like charges and different charges, they also repel or attract respectively, although a bit buggily. 
There are also additional features of a stop button which stops all the blocks and a

Major Challenges:
Conservation of Momentum and Kinetic Energy was pretty challenging. I first tried to solve the final velocity equations by hand until I simply just used Desmos graphing
calculator.
